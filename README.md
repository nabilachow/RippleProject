# This is a Ripple Project for the course COMP 7570, Fall 2020.
# This work is focused on to understand a user issued currency network  in Ripple network and its characteristics. 
# For this purpose we have collected data for 15 days (August 01, 2020 to August 15, 2020) from Ripple website.
# After collecting the data we analyzed it to detect community detection (name infuential addresses).
# We stored our collected data in SQLite database which made it easier to work with almost 2.5 million data.
# To run this repository first run the dbhelper.py file. It will create the database.
# After that run the data_collector.py file. Which collects the data from the website.
